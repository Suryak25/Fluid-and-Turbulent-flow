# Fluid-and-Turbulent-flow
The main objective of this project is to characterise caustic structures of inertial particles in turbulent flow. Caustics are folds of the particle distribution over configuration space. At a caustic, the area of the parallelepiped spanned by separation vectors between the three particles vanishes. In other words, at a caustic, three nearby particles lie in a straight line. The studies of inertial particle dispersion in dierent types of flows have shown that the particles display complex dynamical behaviours like the formation of fractal clusters and caustics. The analysis of the structures formed by inertial particles gives us important information regarding the Stokes number of particles and the flow.
